# Developers

### Development environment
A few things are needed/recommended to work on this project. 

Linux/WSL operating system + packages
- There are some features of the bot that use linux shell comamnds to perform certain tasks that may not translate to Windows. MacOS might work with brew. Namely, imagemagick and subprocess

Text editor with LSP & linter

- The code in this repo is auto-formatted by Ruff, and the type choices I make are based on feedback from Pyright

Local database instance

- To properly test the bot, you will need a local instance of the 200 Lounge database. I use MySQL. MariaDB or Postgres might also work, but I can't guarantee the code I write is 1:1 translatable.

Discord bot for your own testing

- You will need to sign up for a Discord Developer account and create your own bot for testing.
