# Developers

## Development environment
A few things are needed/recommended to work on this project.

**RECOMMENDED: Linux/WSL operating system + packages**
- There are some features of the bot that use linux shell commands to perform certain tasks that may not translate to Windows. MacOS might work with brew. Namely, imagemagick and subprocess

**Text editor with LSP & linter**

- The code in this repo is auto-formatted by Ruff, and the type choices I make are based on feedback from Pyright

## Setup

### [Create a Discord Developer account](https://discord.com/developers/docs/)

Create a bot user, save the token for later use

### Install MySQL Community Server 8.0.36 or MariaDB

I recommend looking up online how to remove the insecure defaults for MariaDB.

**Ubuntu/Debian**

(I was only able to get MySQL running on Ubuntu. Debian does not like MySQL...sad)

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server
```
or
```bash
sudo apt install mariadb-server
```

**Windows**

[MySQL Community Server 8.0.36](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/download)

### Install system packages

**Ubuntu/Debian**

```bash
sudo apt install git, imagemagick, virtualenv, python3, python3-venv
```

**Windows**

```
N/A
```

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/billypom/200-Bot.git
```

### Create a virtual environment

Might not be necessary on Windows

```bash
cd 200-Bot
virtualenv venv
activate
```

### Install the project requirements

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create DB Test data

This user runs integration tests and will handle the creation and deletion of the bot's mysql.user record while testing

Replace 'localhost' with your server hostname, if not running locally

```sql
CREATE USER 'test_runner'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE>';
CREATE DATABASE test_lounge_dev CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
GRANT CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP on test_lounge_dev.* to 'test_runner'@'localhost';
```

### Create local development database

```sql
-- coming soon
```

### Update `config.py`

```py
# Bot config
TOKEN = ""
BOT_ID = 0

# Guild config - your guild ID goes here
LOUNGE = []

# DB config for Discord Bot
# Create your own mysql.user
HOST = "localhost"
PASS = ""
USER = ""
DTB = "lounge_dev"

# DB config for integration test user (test-runner from the README)
TEST_HOST = "localhost"
TEST_PASS = ""
TEST_USER = "test_runner"
TEST_DTB = "test_lounge_dev"
```

Run the bot

```
python3 main.py
```

:)
